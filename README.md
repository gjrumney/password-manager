# password-manager
A simple, JSON-based password manager ðŸ”‘
<br></br>

**Notes:** ðŸ“„
- Extremely proud of my lack of CHEATING this time around.
- Now properly understand the bane of my existence that was JSON, and found a use for an old project in the process.
- First time, too, for finding old code useful: looking to the generating password function.
- As a reward, dad has handed me an enormous book detailing the _Python 3 Standard Library by Example_.
- Functionality-wise, a master-password feature was suggested - WIP!
